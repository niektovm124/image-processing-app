INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Requirements: A c++ compiler, the Qt and OpenCV library (version 2.4) +
development headers.

This project uses CMake as a build system. On *nix, running the
build.sh script should take care of most things (tested on Arch
Linux).

On Windows, the functional equivalent of the build script is as follows:
Run these commands from the directory where this file is located:
> (Create the "build" directory if it doesn't exist).
> cd build
> cmake ..
> make
This should build the executable `image-processing` which can be found
in `build/src/`.
Alternatively, use the CMake GUI to select the "code" directory as source,
a directory of your choice (e.g. create "build") as destination, and
an environment of your choice as the project generator.
This was tested on Windows XP and Windows Vista with Visual Studio 9 2008
as the CMake generator. The code then compiled and ran in Visual Studio
(in debug mode as default).

Run cmake with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to get a debug build (will
e.g. enable array out-of-bounds checks in Qt.
